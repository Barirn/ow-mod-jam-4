# OUTER WILDS: ESCAPE ROOM

![ESCAPE ROOM LOGO](Banner.png)

On your adventures, you came across a mysterious black and white cube. You decided to investigate it, but when you did, the world faded away. When you came to, you found yourself in a mysterious chamber with no clear exit, only a firmly locked door. There's no text anywhere to give you instructions, and you're all alone...can you escape?

This was made as an unofficial entry to the October 2024 Outer Wilds Modding Jam, which had the themes of "Escape" and "Isolation", with the restriction of "Minimal Text". We (xen and GameWyrm) were judges for the Jam, so we couldn't actually compete, but we decided to still create a short but puzzle-focused entry anyway for the fun of it.
